                <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="">
                <p>As a passionate student and aspiring entrepreneur, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software
                    Development from Brigham Young University-Idaho. My academic journey is my top priority, and I'm
                    excited to apply my skills and knowledge in real-world scenarios. In addition to my studies, I've
                    also had the opportunity to work on various projects as a graphic designer and video editor. I've
                    developed educational content, video courses, and even built a brand in the healthy baked treats
                    space with Doxa Pâtisserie. Through Doxa Pâtisserie, we aim to deliver healthier, elegant baked
                    goods while engaging with customers. I'm always looking for ways to collaborate, share ideas, and
                    push boundaries. Feel free to connect if you're interested in educational innovation, creative
                    design, healthy baking, or software development! Let's inspire and grow together.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Jos is a city in the North-Central region of Nigeria. The city has a population of about 900,000
                        residents based on the 2006 census. Popularly called J-Town, it is the administrative capital
                        and largest city of Plateau State. The city is situated on the Jos plateau, which lies within
                        the Guinea Savannah of North-Central Nigeria. It connects most of the North-Eastern capitals to
                        the Federal Capital Territory Abuja by road. Driving in and out of Jos, traffic encounters very
                        steep and windy bends and mountainous sceneries typical of the plateau, from which the state
                        derives its name.

                        During the period of British colonial rule, Jos became an important center for tin mining after
                        large deposits of cassiterite, the main ore for the metal, were discovered. It is also the
                        trading hub of Plateau State as commercial activities are steadily increasing.</p>
